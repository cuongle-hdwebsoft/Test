- index.ts was a file which i deployed in Vercel in production mode. As you can see in ./src/index.ts line 68

- Expected value should be: "Currently, your query is not available now. But we will approve it soon. Thanks 1"

- And this change was in commit 4f82a5fe2e2fc8f44339693c639ce19d462a1e0d
